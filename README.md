# Rails Blog

> The Personal Blog  app keeps track of all your blog, article , and essay . It will allow you to save the article, keep track of what you have, create an article, and generate an essay list based on what you have and what you are missing from the article. Also, since sharing the article is an important part of the essay, the app should allow you to make them public, so anyone can access them.
